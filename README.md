This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Admin User Setup

To access the dashboard, you'll need to create an admin user account. There are utility scripts provided to help with this:

### Using the Admin User Creation Script

1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run the script with:
   ```bash
   node create_admin_user.mjs
   ```
   
3. This will create an account with the default credentials:
   - Email: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
   
4. You can also specify custom credentials:
   ```bash
   node create_admin_user.mjs your-email@example.com your-password
   ```

### Alternative Methods

For other ways to create an admin user, see `LOGIN_GUIDE.md` and `LOGIN_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
